You have to create a simple React/React-Redux App that "fetches" a response into Redux state, 
displays a dropdown with the results, and upon changing a selection, it's value (not title) has to be displayed somewhere.

Criteria:
* On button click the data is "fetched"  (fetches json from server and saves response in Redux state)
* Dropdown has to be displayed from redux state (takes response from Redux state and dispays it in Dropdown list)
* On change, the value has to be shown somewhere (shows selected value bellow, value is taken from the Dropdown list through even and not from the Redux state)

P.S. You can use default bootstrap styles if you wish.
